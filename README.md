DupliGator is a predator capable of finding (and if you're feeling lucky, delEATing) duplicate files within a directory structure.

NOTE:  Duplicates, one will be deleted, then a link added in the location to the other version.

TODO:</h2>
* Don't have the delete/link thing completely worked out yet.
* UI should create a sparse directory tree of ALL conflicting files.  That way you can do checkboxes and "directory and higher" functionality
* Integrate this with a copy system.
